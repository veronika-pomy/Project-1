# Sous Chef

An application created for health conscious amateur cooks

## Project Goals

### Applications were required to utilize the following:

A CSS framework other than Bootstrap

At least two server-side APIs

Client-side storage to store persistent data

### In addition Applications were expected to:

Be deployed to GitHub Pages

Be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input)

Not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

Be responsive.

Have a polished UI.

Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id-naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
